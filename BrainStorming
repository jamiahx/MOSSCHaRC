3 Variable Interface:
  Scalable Parallel Size:
    Twice the wires=One full PARALLEL SIZE (PS) bigger:
    PS0=1 Wire, PS1=2w, PS1.5=3w, PS2=4w, PS2.25=5w, etc.
  Scalable Serial Size:
    Twice the speed (in Hz)=One full SERIAL SIZE (SS) Bigger:
    SS0=Fundamental Frequency (TBD), SS1=2x, SS1.5=3x, SS2=4w, SS2.25=5w, etc.
  Scalable Number-Prefix Size:
    Half the wire Interval (with a base2-base10 adjustment)=Half the NUMBER-PREFIX SIZE (NPS);
    1/1000 the wire interval=1/10 the NPS=One full NPS smaller:
    NPS4mini~16mm, NPS3mini~8mm NPS2mini~4mm, NPS1mini~2mm, NPS0mini=NPS10micro=1mm, NPS9micro=0.5mm~512Âµm

Main parts of a conventional computer (for reference):

      A few ALUs
      L2 Memory
    L3 Memory
  GPU
    ???
    Lots of ALUs

    I/O
    Northbridge
    Southbridge
    Integrated Power Supply
  Seperate Power Supply

Fungible vs. Classic Modular
  Fungible: each unit is a self-sufficient (albeit possibly specialized) computer
  Classic Modular: each unit is only a part of a computer

Daul system: main module system is fungible, secondary/per-module system is classicly modular
  (hmm, I'll follow this method for awhile)

FPGA Chipbridge for Dev
Modular Chipbridge for Normal
Static Chipbridge for Embedded/Small/Cheapo

Jargon:
Chipbridge - any chip that provides the interfaces for two or more components within a module (think Northbridge/Southbridge)
Module Interface - The chip(s) and physical port that provide the interface for two or more modules
