# Protocol for Module Interface Initialization Session
When powered off, the Wires default to ground
Each Wire is assumed to be connected to multiple modules through a bus and to different modules than the other Wires until configured differently
Any wires that transmitted power (that wasn't noise or static electricity) to Module A at any time while Module A was powering up are considered Wires that Module A powered up from
Module A will recieve (square-wave?) AC current from already powered up modules or power source modules turned on, charge an onboard capacitor or something, and then start up the Interfaces
Once Module A is powered up
	On the Wires that Module A powered up from, send "Oh, Hai" signal
		If/when a reply "Oh, Hai" signal is recieved, then register that there is at least one (more) module on the other side of the wire; Until then, assume each Wire is connected to a dumb power source (like a wall outlet)
	On the Wires that Module A didn't power up from
		Pass on the AC Current recieved at the mean timing offset
		If nothing is detected at one of the wires after foo seconds, turn off

Check if setup is unchanged. If unchanged and there are no reset orders, reuse old configuration and end initialization.

Count number of modules connected to each wire

Register capabilities of each interface of each module at each wire

Associate Wires that are connected to the same module

Register capabilities of each module at each wire

Dedicate wires and virtual buses (sections of bandwidth of wires) to certain tasks/data/power/whatever
(this part will be able to dynamically change, if needed)

(account for simultaneous power-up)
	Transmit the configuration for each wire at Standard Frequency at the respective wire
	IF the Hash recieved
