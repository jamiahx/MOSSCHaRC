3 Variable Interface:
	Scalable Parallel Size:
		Twice the wires=One full PARALLEL SIZE (PS) bigger:
		PS0=1 Wire, PS1=2w, PS1.5=3w, PS2=4w, PS2.25=5w, etc.
	Scalable Serial Size:
		Twice the speed (in Hz)=One full SERIAL SIZE (SS) Bigger:
		SS0=Fundamental Frequency (TBD), SS1=2x, SS1.5=3x, SS2=4w, SS2.25=5w, etc.
	Scalable Number-Prefix Size:
		Half the wire Interval (with a base2-base10 adjustment)=Half the NUMBER-PREFIX SIZE (NPS);
		1/1000 the wire interval=1/10 the NPS=One full NPS smaller:
		NPS4mini~16mm, NPS3mini~8mm NPS2mini~4mm, NPS1mini~2mm, NPS0mini=NPS10micro=1mm, NPS9micro=0.5mm~512Âµm

Daul Modularity System: main module system uses fungible modules, secondary/per-module system uses classicly modular parts

Full module can range from a complete computer (SoC or Full Motherboard) to a fungible part of a computer (CPU, GPU, memory, storage, Comms chip)

Dynamic Module has submodules (ALU, Executive/Control Core, L1/L2/L3 Memory, Threading cores, pipelines, FPU, Crypo-Core) connected by chipbridges

FPGA Chipbridge for Dev
Modular Chipbridge for Normal
Static Chipbridge and Module for Embedded/Small/Cheapo

Jargon/Made-Up-Words:
Chipbridge - any chip or wires that provide the interfaces for two or more components within a module (think Northbridge/Southbridge)
Module Interface - The chip(s) and physical port that provide the interface for two or more modules
Fungible: each unit is a self-sufficient (albeit possibly specialized) computer
Classicly Modular: each unit is only a part of a computer
