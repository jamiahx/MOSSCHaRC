As of right now, the legal stuff for MOSSCHaRC is not ready. Therefore, I am implementing and activating a "Lockdown Copyright" for this version of MOSSCHaRC, all previous versions of MOSSCHaRC (including those under its previous name of MOSCHaRC), and indefinately for all future versions of MOSSCHaRC: no one may use, modify, or distribute any version of MOSSCHaRC without my expressed opinion while this "Lockdown Copyright" is active, except for feedback, questions about the project, or journalistic purposes. I plan to make MOSSCHaRC fully open source and shift over to an open-source license once the project is ready, but I do not want to go into all the legal stuff right now.
