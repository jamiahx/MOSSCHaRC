Modular, Open-Source, Scalable, Classicly Hackable, and Reconfigurable Computer

If you're a hardware hacker or a DIYer, you've probably noticed it. Arduino, Beagle, Rasberry Pi and other open source computers are getting more powerful. Thing is, they aren't powerful enough compared to conventional computers.

This project hopes to change that. Its goal? To create a universal system to create any kind of computer: UltraBook, DVR, NAS, Cell Phone, Gaming Computer, Mining Rig, Server, Supercomputer, you-name-it.
Also, with its level of modularity, you will be able to use a bunch of Intel 8080 CPU modules with a Nvidia Tesla GPGPU.
