Modular, Open-Source, Scalable, Classicly Hackable, and Reconfigurable Computer

If you're a hardware hacker or a DIYer, you've probably noticed it. Arduino, Beagle, Rasberry Pi and other open source boards are becoming full-fledged computers. But, to be able to stack up to conventional computers, they need:
				"More power! *grunt*" â€“Tim Taylor

Building such a computer needs to be easy to build and modify at a very basic level, like Arduino, highly scalable and compatible, like no other. That's why this project exists: To create a connections framework for creating any kind of computer: Nainite Fleet, Claytronics, UltraBook, DVR, NAS, Cell Phone, Gaming Computer, Mining Rig, Server, Supercomputer, you-name-it.

Modular - able to use an array of Intel 8080 CPU modules with a Nvidia Tesla GPGPU module; also come in fungible modules
Open Source - GPL 3.0 for now
Scalable - as big or as small as current manufacturing will allow
Classicly Hackable - able to (manually) hijack and modify the framework for what ever purpose
Reconfigurable - Able to physically rearrange the modules into any form, even while they're running
Computer - As in Nerds
